# Car Damage Detection and Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the Car Damage Detection and Analysis project! This application allows users to upload images of their cars, and it provides an analysis of the damage extent. The system highlights the damaged areas in the images and returns a damage percentage. Additionally, the results are visualized with a pie chart to offer a clear and comprehensive understanding of the damage distribution.

## Features

- *Image Upload*: Users can upload images of their cars directly through the application interface.
- *Damage Detection*: The system analyzes the uploaded images to identify and highlight the damaged areas on the car.
- *Damage Percentage*: The application calculates the extent of the damage and provides a percentage value indicating the severity.
- *Visualization*: The results are visualized using a pie chart, helping users to easily understand the damage distribution.

## How It Works

1. *Image Upload*: Users upload an image of the car that needs to be analyzed.
2. *Processing*: The image is processed using advanced image recognition algorithms to detect and highlight the damaged areas.
3. *Analysis*: The system calculates the damage percentage based on the identified damaged regions.
4. *Results*: The highlighted image, damage percentage, and a pie chart visualization are presented to the user.
